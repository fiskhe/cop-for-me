  Visualizing Climate Scenarios
</h1>

<h2>
  A Warming Earth
</h2>
<p>
  The <strong><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/">global scientific community is virtually
  undivided</a></strong> when it comes to answering the question of whether the Earth is warming –
  the answer is a resounding yes. In 2020, the average surface temperature of Earth was 2.14˚F (1.19 °C) warmer than
  pre-industrial averages and 1.76 °F (0.98 °C) warmer than the 20th century average. 2020 isn’t the warmest year in
  recorded history, as that title belongs to 2016. However, year-to-year fluctuations cannot hide the <strong>alarming
  upward
  trajectory</strong> of the global temperature average, and its rising is only accelerating in pace.

<h2>
  Anthropogenic Forcings
</h2>
<p>
  How do we know that the currently seen warming temperatures are human-caused rather than due to natural fluctuations
  in the world’s climate? One tool used by scientists to explore the causes of global warming is
  <strong>counterfactual</strong> climate
  scenarios. These scenarios run simulations of what the state of the world would be if human activity (such as
  manufacturing and transportation activities) were not included as variables. As can be seen below, the models that do
  not include anthropogenic factors are incapable of accurately predicting the observed climate we are seeing today.

<h2>
  Future Climate Projections
</h2>
<p>
  Before <strong><a href="intro.html">COP26</a></strong>, 143 of the Paris Agreement’s Parties officially updated their
  Nationally Determined Contributions
  (NDCs), which represent the degree to which a country pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The goal
  of the Paris Agreement is for each party to submit increasingly ambitious NDCs, which is largely the case. The graph
  below shows the initial NDCs set in 2016 in gray and the newly updated NDCs in blue. The new NDCs are more ambitious
  than those set in 2016, but they still indicate an increase in carbon emissions compared to historical averages in
  1990, 2005, 2010, and other years.
</p>
<p>
  Even after COP26, current pledges are still not enough to meet the Agreement’s broad goal of keeping global warming
  <strong>“well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels,”</strong> much less meet the Agreement’s more ambitious vision
  of limiting
  temperature increases <strong>“to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.”</strong> Because climate modelers cannot say
  for certain what
  the exact temperature outcome of current or future NDCs will be, the IPCC has established ranges of scenarios that
  vary from best case to worst case. Here is a visualization of these scenarios from the most recent <strong><a
  href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/ndc-synthesis-report">NDC
  Synthesis
  Report</a>:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  This graph shows the amount of emissions that are permissible in order to be compliant with various climate scenarios.
  The lowest, teal line labeled “below 1.5 °C” shows that we may need to be carbon negative by 2060 in order to achieve
  this goal. To be carbon negative means that humans must take in more carbon than they emit at the aggregate level.
  This scenario also requires rapid decreases in emissions beginning <strong>now.</strong> The other scenarios, “1.5 °C
  with limited
  overshoot” and “lower 2 °C” do not require us to be GHG negative according to current climate models. However, they
  also are more likely to occur only if emissions decrease by 2030. Finally, the red line labeled “NDCs” at the top
  indicates the projected emissions if all Parties to the Agreement meet their emission reduction targets.
</p>

<p>
  In order to be compliant with the Paris Agreement’s goal of 1.5 °C, GHG emissions in 2030 should be about 45% <strong>lower</strong>
  than those in 2010. However, the new NDCs still lead to a projected 15.9% <strong>increase</strong> in GHG emissions
  in 2030 compared
  to 2010. Clearly, the Earth is in dire need of more ambitious NDCs and legally powerful, rather than merely symbolic,
  policy actions by key stakeholders, those with the power and responsibility to enact change in developed countries’
  energy structures.

  Resources for Climate Action

<p>
  The purpose of this site is to provide education on climate change and the role of the UN in global mitigation
  efforts, but below are some additional resources for how you might begin to take personal climate action.
