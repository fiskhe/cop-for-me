  Visualizing Climate Scenarios

<h2>
  A Warming Earth
</h2>
<p>
  The global scientific community is undivided when it comes to answering the question of whether the Earth is warming – the answer is a resounding yes. In 2020, the average surface temperature of Earth was 2.14˚F (1.19 °C) warmer than pre-industrial averages and 1.76 °F (0.98 °C) warmer than the 20th century average. 2020 isn’t the warmest year in recorded history, as that title belongs to 2016. However, year-to-year fluctuations cannot hide the alarming upward trajectory of the global temperature average, and its rising is only accelerating in pace.

<h2>
  Anthropogenic Forcings
</h2>
<p>
  How do we know that the currently seen warming temperatures are human-caused rather than due to natural fluctuations in the world’s climate? One tool used by scientists to explore the causes of global warming is counterfactual climate scenarios. These scenarios run simulations of what the state of the world would be if human activity (such as manufacturing and transportation activities) were not included as variables. As can be seen below, the models that do not include anthropogenic factors are incapable of accurately predicting the observed climate we are seeing today.

<h2>
  Future Climate Projections
</h2>
<p>
  Before COP26, 143 of the Paris Agreement’s Parties officially updated their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which represent the degree to which a country pledges to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The goal of the Paris Agreement is for each party to submit increasingly ambitious NDCs, which is largely the case. The graph below shows the initial NDCs set in 2016 in gray and the newly updated NDCs in blue. The new NDCs are more ambitious than those set in 2016, but they still indicate an increase in carbon emissions compared to historical averages in 1990, 2005, 2010, and other years.
</p>
<p>
  Even after COP26, current pledges are still not enough to meet the Agreement’s broad goal of keeping global warming “well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels,” much less meet the Agreement’s more ambitious vision of limiting temperature increases “to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.” Because climate modelers cannot say for certain what the exact temperature outcome of current or future NDCs will be, the IPCC has established ranges of scenarios that vary from best case to worst case. Here is a visualization of these scenarios from the most recent NDC Synthesis Report:
</p>

<p>
  This graph shows the amount of emissions that are permissible in order to be compliant with various climate scenarios. The lowest, teal line labeled “below 1.5 °C” shows that we may need to be carbon negative by 2060 in order to achieve this goal. To be carbon negative means that humans must take in more carbon than they emit at the aggregate level. This scenario also requires rapid decreases in emissions beginning now. The other scenarios, “1.5 °C with limited overshoot” and “lower 2 °C” do not require us to be GHG negative according to current climate models. However, they also are more likely to occur only if emissions decrease by 2030. Finally, the red line labeled “NDCs” at the top indicates the projected emissions if all Parties to the Agreement meet their emission reduction targets.
</p>

<p>
  In order to be compliant with the Paris Agreement’s goal of 1.5 °C, GHG emissions in 2030 should be about 45% lower than those in 2010. However, the new NDCs still lead to a projected 15.9% increase in GHG emissions in 2030 compared to 2010. Clearly, the Earth is in dire need of more ambitious NDCs and legally powerful, rather than merely symbolic, policy actions by key stakeholders, those with the power and responsibility to enact change in developed countries’ energy structures.

  The purpose of this site is to provide education on climate change and the role of the UN in global mitigation efforts, but below are some additional resources for how you might begin to take personal climate action.
