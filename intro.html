        Anthropogenic Climate Change
    </h2>
    <p>
        <strong> Anthropogenic climate change </strong> refers to rising global temperature averages that are brought on
        by
        human activities,
        such as the release of increasing quantities of greenhouse gases (GHG) and particulate matter into the
        atmosphere.
        Climate change is more than just pollution, although both issues stem from human industrial activities and have
        serious consequences on human and environmental health. The <strong><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">long-term
        effects of global warming</a></strong> include more frequent
        and intensified natural disasters, including hurricanes; sea level rise that renders coastal areas
        uninhabitable;
        impacts on agricultural yields, which may contribute to global food insecurity; and devastating losses of
        biodiversity
        as species go extinct due to habitat loss. For more information on how we know that recent temperature trends
        are
        attributable to human actions, see the <i><a href="scenarios.html">Visualizing Climate Scenarios</a></i>

<h2>
    The Role of the United Nations
</h2>

<h3>
    The IPCC
</h3>
<p>
    The <strong><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/about/history/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC)</a></strong>
    is a scientific body of the United Nations
    founded in 1988 with
    the purpose of producing regular <strong> climate assessment reports</strong>. These reports supply policymakers
    with
    the scientific
    knowledge necessary to make informed decisions surrounding the mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. Thousands
    of experts work together, on a voluntary basis, to review relevant published literature and synthesize international
    climate findings in the report. The most recent Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) has released one of its three sections
    in 2021, and the entire report will be finalized by the end of 2022. A major finding of the IPCC is the need to
    <strong><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/download/">limit
        the increase in the global temperature average to 1.5 °C</a></strong> in order to avoid catastrophic
    consequences.
</p>

<h3>
    UNFCCC and COP
</h3>
<p>
    Climate change is an inherently global phenomenon, so it makes sense that the United Nations is working to address
    this issue. The <strong><a
        href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-convention/what-is-the-united-nations-framework-convention-on-climate-change">
    United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a></strong> was created in 1992
    and came into
    effect in 1994. As its name suggests, the UNFCCC sets up a framework for countries to discuss climate change at an
    annual meeting called the <strong> Conference of the Parties (COP) </strong> . At these meetings, states usually aim
    to create or amend
    international climate treaties and agreements. The Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement are two climate treaties
    that have resulted from COP meetings, and each is named after the host city of their respective COP.
</p>

<h3>
    The Paris Agreement
</h3>
<p>
    At the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted as the most recent climate
    treaty among the Parties to the UNFCCC. The Paris Agreement replaced the first GHG reduction treaty, the Kyoto
    Protocol, that had held force since COP3 in 1997. The Kyoto Protocol was deemed an insufficient mechanism for
    reducing
    GHG emissions because three key parties never ratified it: the U.S., China. and India. In order to convince all
    Parties to join the Paris Agreement, some of the teeth of the previous treaty were removed. Under the
    “non-adversarial
    and non-punitive” <strong><a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf">Paris
    Agreement</a></strong>, countries set their own Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), yet there are
    no penalties for failing to meet one’s NDC. Thus, a major criticism of the Paris Agreement is the lack of incentives
    for countries to set and meet ambitious reduction goals.
</p>

<h3>
    COP26
</h3>
<p>
    After COVID-19 caused the Parties not to meet in 2020, COP26 was held in Glasgow, UK from October 31st through
    November 12th, 2021. Prior to this meeting, the majority of Parties reestablished or updated their NDCs, as they are
    to do every five years beginning in 2020, and a new <strong><a
        href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs/ndc-synthesis-report">NDC
    Synthesis Report</a> </strong> was released by the UN on October 25th, 2021.

    Climate Scenarios</a></i> page of

                <li>The Pact is the first UN climate agreement to mention the need for a “phase-down of unabated coal
                    power.”
                    Coal is the leading contributor to global temperature increases, and China notably announced that it
                    would
                    begin decreasing its coal consumption in 2026.
                </li>
                <li>The Pact also calls for more ambitious targets to be made in 2022 and for annual reports to be
                    created to
                    summarize nations’ progress made toward these targets.
                </li>
                <li>Critics state that the Pact still lacks important details, like to what extent richer countries
                    should
                    financially aid developing countries’ energy transitions and climate adaptations.

        Climate Justice
    </h2>
    <p>
        Climate change is an environmental issue with international consequences. Spillover effects occur because all of
        the
        world’s countries share one global atmosphere. Regardless of where GHGs are emitted, the atmosphere can only
        handle
        a
        certain quantity of emissions before the average global temperature increases. While large, developed countries
        like
        the United States have contributed the most to GHG pollution, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/3/bangladesh-global-warming-climate-crisis-seawater-agriculture">developing states</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/01/marshall-islands-sea-levels-cop26-tina-stege/">small island nations</a> are
        already
        becoming the first countries to experience the damaging effects of climate change. The concept of <strong><a
            href="https://www.mrfcj.org/pdf/Principles-of-Climate-Justice.pdf">climate justice</a></strong>
        highlights the ethical implications of climate change and the need for a just transition that allows poorer
        countries
        to develop sustainably, which can be achieved through technology sharing and proposed <strong>"<a
